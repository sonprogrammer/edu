        <p id="targetp">This is the extremely long paragraph that we want to highlight
            all words longer than eight characters in. To be, or not to be, that is the
            question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of
            outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing
            end them. To die—to sleep, No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache
            and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
            Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep, perchance to dream—ay,
            there's the rub: For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have
            shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause—there's the respect That makes
            calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
            Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of dispriz'd love,
            the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of
            th'unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin?
            Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the
            dread of something after death, The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn No
            traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have
            Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience doth make cowards of us
            all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast
            of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their
            currents turn awry And lose the name of action.This is the extremely long
            paragraph that we want to highlight all words longer than eight characters in.</p>

            Hamlet is arguably Shakespeare’s greatest play,
            <strong>tragicomic</strong>, complex and one of the best of his era. It is a
            <strong>psychologically gripping</strong>
            and
            <strong>morally ambivalent</strong>, play that will haunt you long after its
            final scene ends. Like his other great play, Romeo and Juliet, the hero dies.
